# SkySongs

This project uses a weather API and a spotify API to suggest songs based on the weather. I also implemented a search route so the user can browse songs from the spotify library and check their valence level, artist, and album.

## Plans to improve

  - Make this a full stack website so a user can make an account and favorite/save songs for certain weather, almost like a playlist for ceratin days.
  - Create a filter option so its easier to search for more specific songs.
  - Fix/update some visual aspects.
